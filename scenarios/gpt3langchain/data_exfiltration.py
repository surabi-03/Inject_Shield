"""
This demonstration is based on the following scenario:
An attacker wants to exfiltrate the real name of a Chat App user that is looking at their social media profile.
The Chat App Application can read data from the web through GET requests, view the current page the user is on
and commit search queries to provide up-to-date content.
The user looks at the attacker's social media profile and tells Chat App to summarize the content,
after which Chat App sees the injection and comes under the attacker's control.
From that point forward the attacker can use Chat App to exfiltrate the user's real name.
This could also be used to target journalists or other groups of people, by planting poisoned injections in specific places or
tagging them with specific keywords that those people are likely to stumble upon.
